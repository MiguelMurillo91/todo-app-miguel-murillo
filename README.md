# Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to create a simple Todo application using React.js. This application will fetch and display todos for different users from a dummy API.

# Requirements:

-   The App.js file contains a basic structure for the Todo application. You need to implement the functionality to fetch todos for different users and display them accordingly. Use the browser FetchAPI to retrieve todos for the selected user from the dummy API: https://dummyjson.com/todos/user/26921.
-   The application should have a dropdown menu to select a user. Upon selecting a user, the application should fetch and display todos specific to that user.
-   While the todos are being fetched, a loading message should be displayed.
-   Ensure that your project follows best practices, semantics, and accessibility requirements.
-   Test your implementation by running the application and verifying the requirements.
-   Ensure your code is properly formatted and well-commented for clarity.
